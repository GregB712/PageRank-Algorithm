## PageRanking Algorithm

#### Decription:
PageRank is a ranking algorithm used to rank homepages in order of importance depending on the linkstructure of the Internet. This or some variation of is often used by search engines to decide which ofmany found pages should be showed first. Since there is a huge amount of homepages on the Internetthe ranking algorithm needs to be extremely fast, but it also needs to be very accurate since most peopledon’t look at more than a couple of results of a search query, regardless of if there was a large numberof hits or not.In this project we expect you to try and implement the method and try it on some sample graphs.Since the number of homepages is very large there is a large amount of ways you can speed up thecalculations depending on how you implement the method. It might be interesting to try some of thesemodifications of the algorithm and see how large of a difference they make when you try it on some large graphs.
